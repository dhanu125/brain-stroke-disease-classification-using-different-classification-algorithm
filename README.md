Stroke is the number one leading cause of mortality and obesity in many countries. A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain results
in cell death. It is nowadays a leading cause of death all over the world. Several risk factors believe to be related to the cause of stroke has been found by inspecting the affected individuals. Using these risk factors, a number of works have been carried out for predicting and classifying stroke diseases. Most of the models are based on data mining and machine learning algorithms. This study preprocessing data to improve the image quality of CT scans of stroke patients by optimizing the quality of image to improve image results and to reduce noise, and also applying machine learning algorithms to classify the patient’s images into two sub-types of stroke disease, namely ischemic stroke and stroke hemorrhage. In this work, we have used four machine learning algorithms to detect the type of stroke that can possibly occur or occurred form a person’s physical state and medical report data. We have collected a good number of Brain CT scan
images from the Lab and use them to solve our problem. The classification result shows that the result is satisfactory and can be used in real time medical report. We believe that machine learning algorithms can help better understanding of diseases and can be a good healthcare companion.
